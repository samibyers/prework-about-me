      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I graduated from UW in 2018 with a Bachelor's of Science in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology. I always thought I wanted to work in healthcare. My plan since college was to go to PA school, but recently my plan changed. I just quit my third job in direct patient care because I have never been happy in the field and I don't have a passion for working with patients. I decided to take this coding bootcamp because I enjoy working on a computer and I want to learn more about how computers work in order to get a job in the tech industry. </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born in Olympia, Washington and lived there until I was 16 when I went to live in Switzerland for a year for a Rotary youth exchange program. I was so lucky for that opportunity! I then moved back home and I lived in Seattle to attend University and work.  </p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy hiking, bouldering, biking, and kombucha brewing. I also have a dog and a kitten that occupy lots of my free time!</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I am not sure what I would be doing in my dream job, but ultimately I am hoping to gain experience in the tech industry and be able to work from home in the future. I have so much to learn, I'm not sure what I will like doing the most!</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I only recently moved to San Antonio, Texas with my partner for his job and the chance to experience a different part of the country. I have plans to move back to Seattle soon. Living in Teaxas has made me appreciate everything Seattle has to offer. I think Seattle is one of the best cities in the world to live in. </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I enjoy working with computers and I think it is something that I would be good at and enjoy.</p>
